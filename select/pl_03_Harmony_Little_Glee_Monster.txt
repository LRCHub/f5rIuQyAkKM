More walls since Good Friday he said
There's nothing good about that
Down Bombay Street
There's flames at our feet
And they burn like the Indian sun
It's a far cry from home you land
Your brothers and sisters behind
This battle scar's long
Like a mourning song
You know though you never had learned
Now we'll never know
The man you'd have been
The one who brought peace
To a land born in pain
Taught love to a daughter
Kindness to a son
But you've ended before you've begun
You've ended before you've begun
And a Main Street became the frontline
My beloved a casualty of time
It's wrong, it's wrong
No matter what side you're on
To end them before they've begun
We'll never know
The man you'd have been
The one who brought peace
To a land born in pain
Taught love to his daughter
Kindness to his son
But you've ended before you've begun
You've ended before you've begun
Let's put it all behind us
Let's live in harmony
Let's put it all behind us
Let's live in harmony
